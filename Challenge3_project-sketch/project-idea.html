<h1>San Diego Freeway bottlenecks</h1>
<h3>Times, Duration, and Possible Contributors</h3>
There is an obvious need for better understanding of traffic congestion times and durations in major cities. A quick search online across a variety of platforms shows plenty of people asking, "what is the traffic like in San Diego along _____ freeway?" Many of the answers are fairly accurate, but still many others generalize regional congestion trends too far and are dead wrong. Often times, you have to ask many residents far and wide to get an accurate picture of traffic in San Diego. (Although Google maps can helpful for specific traffic queries, a lot of posters want to know general trends that will allow them to make more macroscopic decisions about where they want to live, work, and play.)

In response to this need, I want to conduct a formal research into the congested freeways in San Diego and visualize this data. I want to limit my scope to just a few freeways but add more as I find I am able to. 
<br /><br />
Additionally, I want to couple this data with neighborhood economics to potentially identify risk factors for freeway congestion. My own intuition having been born and raised in San Diego is that if you live in a affluent neighborhood and are commuting to work in a relatively less affluent neighborhood, you won't find much congestion. However, there will almost always be congestion if you're attempting to commute the other way around. 
<br /><br />
The simplistic assumption here is that commuters that contribute to congestion tend to live at a means equal to or below the price of the surrounding neighborhood they work in. It's rare that you'll find someone choosing to live far away from work in a pricier neighborhood, unless they are an executive, VP, etc. And if they chose to live in the neighborhood of where they work, well, then they wouldn't be getting on the freeway and, in turn, would not contribute to congestion. Thus a lot of traffic I've experienced vectors from poorer neighborhoods to richer neighborhoods in the morning and vice versa in the evenings.
