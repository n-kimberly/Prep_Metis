I pulled the stats on d3's commit activity for the past year

 ~ curl "https://api.github.com/repos/d3/d3/stats/commit_activity" > d3_commit-activity.txt

and in the past 52 weeks, the maximum number of commits was 9 and occurred 4 weeks ago on week "1521331200," which is basically just the value of 48 weeks of time in seconds.

In order to obtain this number, I wrote a python function that took in the JSON provided through our github API, looped through it and stored the max commit # and week count, and returned these.
